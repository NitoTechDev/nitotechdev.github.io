                <h2>Creating an Overlay for Your Cheats with Direct3D 9</h2>
                <h5>Sep 14, 2025 | Direct3D 9 Overlay Writeup</h5>
                <hr>
                <h3>Why create an overlay for your cheat?</h3>
                    <p>What's the purpose of adding an overlay to your cheat? That's the question I asked myself when first learning about adding an overlay to a cheat I was creating for Skyrim.</p>
                    <p>Overlays can help the cheat developer as well as potential users of a cheat keep up with specific values or toggled cheats. Allowing for more clarity on how your hack operates and it's capabilities.</p>
                
                <h3>What is required to create an overlay?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Things you need:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2010 Direct3D 9 SDK</li>
                        <li>IDE that is setup for Direct3D includes and libraries</li>
                        <li>Game that uses Direct3D 9</li>
                        <li>A DLL that you plan to inject into the game</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                <h3>Downloading the SDK</h3>
                    <p>You can download the SDK from here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812">Microsoft legacy SDK download</a></p>
                    <p>It has already reached it's End of Life and is no longer supported. If you run into any issues installing the SDK it's because you already have a version of it installed.</p>
                    <p>You'll need to uninstall your current version and run the installer again so you can gaurentee you have DirectX 9 installed which is included with this installer</p>

                <h3>Setting up your IDE</h3>
                    <p>Within your IDE of choice (I use Visual Studio, so will give instructions based on that), <br>you can right click on your solution and go to <strong>properties</strong></p>
                    <p>Navigate to <strong>VC++ Directories</strong>, then edit your <strong>Include Directories</strong> to be (ENTER THIS AT A LATER TIME)</p>
                    <p>Then within that same page, you'll edit your <strong>Library Directories</strong> to be (ENTER THIS AT A LATER TIME)</p>
                    <p>Afterwards you can press <strong>apply</strong>, then press <strong>ok</strong>, and your IDE will be setup to include the Direct3D and DirectX includes and libraries!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>These instructions assume you have a solution created for your cheat already.</strong></p>
